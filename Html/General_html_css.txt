1. HTML/CSS Comments and Resets

Commented code is grey and begins with a /* and ends with a */
A generic “comment” may be added or a rule may be temporarily “commented-out” so that it is not read or rendered by the browser.

Generic Comment:
[These Comments may be used as reminders for project colors, document values or other notes.]

/* 
Color values:
#fff - white
#333 - dark grey
#666 - medium grey
#999 - light grey
#9CF - light blue
*/

2. CSS Resets:

CSS Resets remove the HTML browser defaults for margins, padding and many other attributes that you may wish 
to have more control over by overwriting them with your own CSS Rules.

[These Resets avoid conflicts between the browser’s default values and the CSS Rules you write.]

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, pre,
blockquote, ul, ol, dl, li, address, img {
margin: 0px;
padding: 0px;
}
